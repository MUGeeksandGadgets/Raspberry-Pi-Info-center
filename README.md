# Raspberry Pi Personal Information Center
Personal information center built on the Raspberry Pi platform.


<br/>

## Description
This project was constructed using Python 3.5 utilizing Flask.
The aim of this project is to provide a personal information 
center that is easy to use and can be built at a minimum
cost to the user. This center will provide access to weather,
calendar, and potentially relevant news information. At the moment
the only working feature of this project is access to the weather, 
Google Calendar integration is the next item on the to-do list.

## Hardware
At the moment, no hardware has-been put together for this project.
The only meaningful piece of hardware is a Raspberry Pi revision 3.
As soon as I get to this stage in the project, I will post images, instructions,
and links to the parts I used.
